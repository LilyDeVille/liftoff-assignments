# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I want to create a recipe app with a built in grocery list and "virtual pantry". Users will be able to create accounts, add their own recipes, view other people's recipes, and comment/favorite/rate others. Users can also follow others for immediate updates when they add new recipes. The app will also grant people the ability to search for recipes by ingredient, name, and by User as well. 

Users will also be able to create a "digital pantry" using a built in database of basic ingredients and the ability to submit their own they can view recipes and have ingredients they already have in stock marked off or noted to help ease the process of deciding on what to cook. Users will also be able to "Add all needed ingredients" from a recipe page to their grocery list with a simple button.


### Features

User account registration and login: Users will be able to register an account and log into it to add their own recipes and view other's recipes.

Search: Users can search recipes by name, ingredients, type of dish, and by name of the user who submitted it.

Virtual Pantry: Users will be able to add a virtual pantry using ingredients they already have in their own (seasonings, flour, home-grown vegetables, frozen foods) that they can use to help effortless add the ingredients that they do not have from a recipe to their grocery list.

Create a Recipe: Users will be able to create a recipe, add ingredients, step-by-step instructions, substitutions, name the recipe, and write a small introductory paragraph at the start of it as well. Users will also be able to view other's recipes and rate/favorite/comment on them.

Grocery List: The app will come with a built in grocery list that users can immediately add ingredients to from the recipe they are viewing to the list and have the items they already have in their pantry crossed off.
### Technologies

Java

Spring

MySQL

Angular

Javascript

Thymeleaf templates

### What I'll Have to Learn

I am unsure how to say it in more technical terms but I will have to learn how to be able to integrate the grocery list component of the app along with everything else. Having it be a function part of the app that users can add to and cross items off as they need as well as balancing it against the virtual pantry feels like it will be the most difficult portion of the app for me to wrap my head around currently.
